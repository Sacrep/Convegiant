Fry for 5-6 minutes, tossing occasionally, until golden in places.\n  \n  \n  5 - Roast\n  Whack the whole pan into the oven and roast for a further 8-10 minutes, until golden all over and soft throughout.\n  \n  \n  6 - Assemble\n  Once the aubergine is ready, add 1 tbsp of tahini, 100g of yoghurt, and finely grate in 1 clove of  garlic.\n  \n  \n  7 - Mash it up\n  Mash everything together with a potato masher until semi smooth - season to taste with salt and pepper.\n  \n  \n  8 - Add the eggs\n  Create 4 divots in the mix and crack an egg into each.\n  \n  \n  9 - Bake\n  Pop the pan into the oven for a further 8-10 minutes, until the egg whites are set but the yolks still have a wobble.
